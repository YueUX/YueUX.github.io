However, Amity University App is a great app you can take a look at. And its a great point to take an enrollment by GPS or sort of things.For movie apps, its just a stereotype and you can imagine, so I just listed one. With our point of view to this app, we want to create customized watchlists, but I suggest movie reviews should share or connect to database so that everyone can see all of them; otherwise, reviews of certain movie will too be sparse everywhere.For our travelers mate app, we can add our feature to locate ourselves in certain location and find who else is in the neighborhood by GPS like class app. and matching things like movie appAnd I have no idea about the rest. anybody can make supplement"}

To bring incentive to this act of altruism, the plan is to have some unbiased middle man (like a flourishing recycling center or someone with the funds to sponsor recycling programs) control the awarding of points to individuals for recycling what should be recycling and keeping what shouldnt go in the recycling bin out.

Your final functional prototype is due this week. The prototype will be judged in terms of its completeness, detail, and overall quality as well as your design rationale behind it. If there are parts of the prototype that you cannot finish in time, you need to state them clearly and justify why they cannot be done on time, and to what extent they can be simulated by “wizard-of-oz” method to demonstrate the main functions that reflect the original design ideas. By the day of the final exam, you must submit the following informationYour source code and an executable version of the project. If the project cannot be easily run from the executable, provide instructions on how to run it from your installation.A brief description of the final implementation, including what does and does not work, and how to use the program.A lessons learned essay from each group member (at most one page per person) indicating what you learned most about how to design an effective interface from the project or course.Please make a zip file of this information and post it on the Website by the day of the final exam. One fourth of the grade (25 points) will be given for submitting a program that works. The remaining (75) points will be assigned per team member based on the depth and quality of the individual essays.Final peer evaluationBefore the final exam, each team member should submit a peer evaluation of the overall contribution of each team member by email to the TA. The evaluation should includeWhat grade you think the team member deserves and why.Anything else that you would like me to know before assigning final grades. If we do not receive an evaluation from you, then the evaluation statements from the other team members will be given preference."},
